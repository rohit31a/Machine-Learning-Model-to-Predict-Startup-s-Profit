# Machine Learning Model for Prediction of Startup’s Profit

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the profit of startups based on their expenditures in R&D, Administration, and Marketing. By analyzing a dataset comprising information from 50 startups, the project explores how these expenditures impact profitability and selects the best-performing model to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about 50 startups, with the following features:
- **R&D Spending:** Expenditure on research and development.
- **Administration Spending:** Expenditure on administrative activities.
- **Marketing Spending:** Expenditure on marketing activities.
- **Profit:** The profit earned by each startup (target variable).

## Project Objectives
1. **Understand and preprocess the dataset:**
   - Load and inspect the data.
   - Handle any missing values.
   - Perform any necessary feature engineering or transformations.

2. **Construct and evaluate regression models:**
   - Implement various regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and KNN Regression.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the models using the training set.
   - Evaluate the models using the testing set.
   - Calculate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).

3. **Select the best-performing model:**
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Select the model with the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.

## Implementation Details
### Dependencies
- Python (version 3.x)
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

### Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Code Structure
- `main.py`: Main script to load data, preprocess, train models, and evaluate performance.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file (e.g., `50_startups.csv`).
- `models/`: Directory containing trained models (if needed).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development (optional).

### Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Inspect the dataset for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Perform feature scaling if necessary.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn`.
- Train the following regression models:
  - **Linear Regression:** `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`.
  - **Elastic Net Regression:** `ElasticNet` from `scikit-learn`.
  - **KNN Regression:** `KNeighborsRegressor` from `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate each model using regression metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R²)

### Model Selection
- Compare the performance of the models based on the evaluation metrics.
- Select and save the best-performing model.

## Results
The project will output the performance metrics of each model and highlight the best-performing model for predicting startup profits.
